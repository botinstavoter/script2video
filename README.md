# script2video

Creating a video generator from a movie script involves several steps. The process can be quite complex and involves natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, text-to-speech synthesis, and video editing techniques. Here's a high-level approach you can follow to build a basic script-to-video generator:

Parse the Script: Extract dialogue, scene descriptions, and actions from the script.
Generate Scenes: Use predefined or dynamically generated backgrounds and characters.
Animate Characters: Use text-to-speech for dialogue and basic animations for character actions.
Combine Elements into a Video: Assemble the scenes, dialogue, and animations into a coherent video.
Below is an example in Python using basic libraries. This example assumes you have character images and background images ready:

Install necessary libraries:
pip install opencv-python pyttsx3
Create the script-to-video generator:
python

Explanation:

Text-to-Speech: Converts script dialogue to speech and saves it as an audio file.
Video Generation: Combines background and character images, adds dialogue as speech, and writes frames to the video.
Note:

This example uses static images for backgrounds and characters. For more advanced animations, consider using libraries like Blender (for 3D animations) or integrating with animation tools.
os.system(f'play {audio_filename}') is a simple way to play the audio file. You may need to install sox for the play command or use other methods to play audio synchronized with the video frames.
For a fully-fledged movie script to video generator, more advanced techniques involving NLP, computer vision, and custom animations would be required.
